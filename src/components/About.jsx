        <p className='text-center py-8'>
        I've spent the past decade immersed in the ski/bike industry, transitioning through various roles from bike mechanic to mountain operations, including snowmaking for Killington. Throughout this journey, my passion for learning and self-improvement has been unwavering, propelling me into the realm of software development. I've always enjoyed the challenge of deconstructing and constructing things from scratch, which naturally led me to pursue software development as a means of continual growth and innovation.
